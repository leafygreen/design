Along with the launch of the new MongoDB.com website, changes in our visual branding were made. Elements that failed to communicate to the audience that we are a tech company were taken down. That includes all brown color shades, PT Sans (the typeface), trees, branches, and all nature-related graphics.

New assets were given much more breathing space with the use of more white, shades of gray (not 50 of them), and the signature MongoDB green.

We started to envision opportunities of ways to expand and create a stronger bond between the employees, the MongoDB fans, and our customers with our brand.

This newsletter gives us the chance to provide you with some design insight, keep you updated with ongoing changes,  and discover new findings within the company.

As cheesy as it sounds, we are the light energy, and our goal is to have our readers to convert that into chemical energy that will fuel you up with MongoDB pride.
